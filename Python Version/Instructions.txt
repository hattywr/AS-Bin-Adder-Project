Hello! 

- This package should allow for a quick and easy generation of the scripts for adding bins to AS 
(yes I know we have an excel sheet someplace for this with all the formulas, 
but this is less steps and requires no formatting of the data taken from AS - if you've got python installed, its plug and play)

- If adding via a bin export file (via AS console - export bins), all that is required is that you place
the csv in the same folder as this file is being run and name it "bins.csv." From there, you would open a terminal
in powershell or command prompt and run ".\addBinScriptGenerator.py WAREHOUSE_NUM ZONE" 
- enter your warehouse num (seen in the sheet as 001 or something) and your Zone (usually like AS1 or something)
- From there, you should be able to take the generated SQL file and run that in ExactaDB to import bins successfully.
